# Bee-IOT, System for measurement of temperature and humidity in Bee hives
A short background

Simple project for measurements in bee hives with the aim of learning how to improve winter survival of bees.

During winter a lot of bees die and if the bee population gets to small, they cannot keep temperature up and the whole hive dies. Improving winter conditions in the hive can hopefully make more hives survive the winter and produce honey the next year. When you open a hive in spring it can look terrible inside. Dead bees, moisture, mold and bee poo in a mess makes you wonder how anything can live in there.
